   Modified on  ::  2023-03-01 (01 March 2023)
   Version      ::  1.3
   Description  ::  Checks the default location of public keys for SSH in a windows environment (C:\Users\username\.ssh\id_rsa.pub)
                    and strips out everything but the key itself and then copies to clipboard (if -c flag is used) to allow for pasting
                    into a console session on Cisco equipment for ssh authentication. (unfortunately Cisco equipment doesn't like anything
                    but the key in it's configuration). a file named cisco_id_rsa.txt extension is also generated for future use, the .txt
                    extension is chosen to make opening it eassier in a windows environment.
   
   Modification ::  added description and option to copy output to clipboard via -c flag in prepration for public publication

   Example      ::
                  PS> .\sshkeymod.ps1
                  Discovered file in C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
                  Discovered what appears to be a valid RSA Public Key (Begins with 'ssh-rsa ')

                  key file is located at C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\cisco_id_rsa.txt
